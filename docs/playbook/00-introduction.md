# Introduction

Plaited is a design system first UI framework for rapidly designing and developing interfaces as requirements change and evolve. We provide the tools necessary for crafting **Component Driven User Interfaces** with [Web Components](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components).

## Component driven user interfaces

This development and design practice involves building user interfaces with modular components. UIs are built from the "bottom up", starting with sub-atomic design tokens through basic components and progressively combined to assemble screens.

## Event Driven Components

Need to write a paragraph or two on

## Core concepts

- Triggers
- Rules
- Feedback

We feel the best to learn this often to play with it

So [shall we play a game](./01-shall-play-a-game.md)

<!-- # Why?

Modern UI frameworks generally place design systems and design integration as an afterthought to be handled by the community. Further modern UI frameworks are generally data driven. By this we mean that the UI components react to changes in the data passed to them. This is why React is called React. There's nothing wrong with this mental model for engineers but this model doesn't always vibe with our non-engineering partners.

We've discovered over the years Dan Saffer's Microinteraction mental model worked great when pairing with non-engineering partners to discuss our UI and make changes. However that model is fundamentally event driven. Where events are triggered, rules are applied and feedback shows us what has changed.

Back in 2019 we cam across the behavioral programming algorithm which we found aligned with this mental model succinctly and sought to apply it to dom manipulation. We'd mange the event log and rules to manipulate how we change a object. Wether that object is an array, an object literal or in the case of our components the Shadow DOM.

In this doc site we won't start with Components instead as  Design system first framework we'll start with our smallest part, design-tokens the sub-atomic element in modern component driven web applications.
