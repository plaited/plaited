# Accuracy

**95% confidence threshold** - Report uncertainty rather than guess

**Verification first** - Read files before stating implementation details
*Verify:* Did you read the file before commenting on it?

**When uncertain:**
- State the discrepancy clearly
- Explain why you can't confidently recommend a fix
- Present issue to user for resolution
- Never invent solutions

**TypeScript verification** - Use LSP tools for type-aware analysis:
- `lsp-find` - Search symbols across workspace
- `lsp-refs` - Find all usages before modifying
- `lsp-hover` - Verify type signatures
- `lsp-analyze` - Batch analysis of file structure

**Dynamic exploration:**
- Read tool for direct file verification
- Grep/Glob for content and pattern searches
- Prioritize live code over cached knowledge

**Agent-specific applications:**
- Documentation: Only update TSDoc if types match current code
- Architecture: Verify patterns exist in codebase
- Code review: Read files before commenting
- Patterns: Confirm examples reflect actual usage

See .plaited/rules/testing.md for verification in test contexts.
