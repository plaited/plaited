Plaited is a design system first framework for rapidly designing and developing interfaces as requirements change and evolve.

This repository contains the complete source code for Plaited, including many test scripts. However, other test scripts and most of the documentation are managed separately.

**Plaited is open-source, not open-contribution.** If you are reading this on GitHub or some other Git repository or service, then you are looking at a mirror. While the Plaited source code is managed using Git, it is done as a submodule of our Plaited Pro offering.

See our ~~on-line documentation~~ for more information about what Plaited is and how it works.
