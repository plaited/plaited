# Auto-research

Reference for an agent assisting an engineer in wiring a Karpathy-style
**autoresearch** hill-climb loop over a behavioral-program agent. The trace
here is not an eval artifact — it's the **feedback signal** the agent reads to
propose the next mutation. Capture one small experiment, analyze the trace,
keep or discard, repeat on a fixed budget.

This is the iterative-improvement use of the trace primitives. For the
eval-shaped use (capture a run, close it, grade it, compare across runs), see
[Eval](./eval.md) — same primitives, different purpose.

## The loop

Karpathy's autoresearch is a closed-loop hill-climb. Strip the LLM-specific
parts and the recipe is:

1. Read the current state.
2. Make one change (the LLM is the *mutation function* — it proposes the next
   change from the trace of the last run).
3. Commit.
4. Run the experiment on a **fixed budget** (~5-10 min).
5. Measure **one metric**.
6. If improved → keep the commit, advance the branch. If worse → `git reset`.
7. Loop forever.

Where plaited fits: the **"run experiment"** step captures a trace via
`useTrace` (the agent run, with its behavioral coordination layer observed);
the **"measure"** and **"decide"** steps consume that trace. plaited supplies
the capture and (optionally) the divergence analysis; the **loop, the one
metric, the fixed budget, and the keep/discard rule are the consumer's** —
plaited does not ship the loop.

## Public surface (import from `plaited`)

```ts
import {
  behavioral,
  type UseTrace,
  type SendTrace,
} from 'plaited'
```

`useTrace` and `sendTrace` are returned by `behavioral()`. `Trace` is the
engine's closed discriminated union — not directly importable; use inference
via `useTrace((msg) => ...)`. The structural constraint for extension events
is `{ kind: string; timestamp: number }` — define it inline, not as an
imported type.

For analyzing the
reachable branches of a mutated program (optional — see below), also import
the [frontier-analysis](./frontier-analysis.md) functions.

## When to use which

| Need | Use |
|------|-----|
| Capture each experiment's run as a trace | `behavioral<T>()` + `useTrace` (listener receives `Trace \| T`) + `sendTrace` (injects `T`). Same capture wiring as eval. |
| Measure the run via a deterministic metric | Consumer code reading the captured trace (token count, tool-call count, BP-health counts, a domain metric). plaited supplies no metric. |
| Analyze the mutated program's reachable branches between iterations | `exploreFrontiers` / `verifyFrontiers` over the program's `Thread[]`. Optional — only if the mutation changes the behavioral program and you want to know what it can now reach. |
| Decide keep/discard | Consumer code: compare this iteration's metric to the last kept one. The selection function is the hill-climb. |

The capture row is identical to eval's — the *primitives* don't know whether
you're capturing for grading or for iteration. What differs is what you do
with the trace *after* capture: eval closes it and grades; autoresearch
analyzes it and mutates.

## The capture wiring (per iteration)

Each iteration captures its own trace. The boundary is **one experiment** —
from run-start to budget-elapsed or terminal result. The sink is whatever the
`useTrace` callback does; for autoresearch, usually a per-iteration file or
an append to a running log the analyzer reads.

```ts
import { behavioral } from 'plaited'

type AgentEvent =
  | { kind: 'tool_call'; timestamp: number; tool: string }
  | { kind: 'agent_message'; timestamp: number; content: string }

// Per-iteration: construct, capture, run, measure, decide.
async function runOneExperiment(
  threads: Array<{ label: string; rules: any[] }>,
  triggers: Array<{ type: string }>,
  budgetMs: number,
): Promise<{ events: Array<{ kind: string; timestamp: number }>; metric: number }> {
  const program = behavioral<AgentEvent>()
  const { useTrace, sendTrace, useAddThread, useTrigger } = program

  const events = []
  useTrace((msg) => { events.push(msg) })  // callback is the sink

  for (const t of threads) useAddThread()(t)
  for (const trig of triggers) useTrigger()(trig)
  // ...wire the agent SDK's lifecycle to sendTrace as in eval.md...

  // Fixed budget — the experiment ends when the budget elapses OR the run
  // terminates, whichever is first.
  await runWithBudget(budgetMs, () => /* drive the agent */)

  // Measure: consumer-defined metric over the captured trace.
  const metric = measure(events)
  return { events, metric }
}
```

The loop, the keep/discard rule, and the `measure` function are the
consumer's — plaited supplies the capture, not the hill-climb.

## Intake (use `grill-me`)

The autoresearch shape is fixed (mutate → run → measure → keep/discard →
loop), but the *contents* differ by goal. Surface these with the engineer
before wiring:

- **One file the agent can mutate.** Karpathy's loop has exactly one file
  the agent edits between iterations. What is it for this goal? (A skill
  prompt, a thread rule set, a model config, an agent's system prompt.)
- **One metric.** What single number does `measure` produce? (Pass rate on a
  fast shard, token cost, BP-deadlock count, a domain score.) Autoresearch
  with multiple metrics isn't a hill-climb — it's a Pareto problem; keep it
  to one or pick a scalarization.
- **Fixed budget.** How long is one experiment? Karpathy used ~5 min.
  Too short and the metric is noisy; too long and the loop is slow.
- **Keep/discard rule.** Strict improvement only, or improvement within noise
  tolerance? Strict climbs stall on local optima faster; tolerant climbs
  wander. Karpathy's default is strict (keep iff improved).
- **What the agent reads to propose the next mutation.** The trace of the
  last kept run? The diff between last kept and last discarded? A running
  log of kept experiments (`log.jsonl` in the dlg `.auto/` pattern)? This is
  the feedback channel — decide it at intake.
- **Divergence analysis between iterations?** If the mutation changes the
  behavioral program (thread rules, not just the agent's prompt), the
  reachable branches may change. Optionally run `exploreFrontiers` on the
  mutated `Thread[]` to surface new deadlocks or livelocks the mutation
  introduced. Skip if the mutation doesn't touch the behavioral layer.

## A common failure mode: local optima

The hill-climb stalls when the agent finds a small improvement whose every
neighbor is worse — a local optimum far from global. Karpathy's mitigations:
restart from different starting seeds, add randomization to the mutation
step, or run multiple loops in parallel from different starts. This isn't a
plaited concern — plaited supplies the capture, not the search — but surface
it at intake so the engineer builds a stall-detector (e.g. N iterations with
no kept improvement → restart) rather than letting the loop spin forever.

## The boundary with eval

Autoresearch *can* use an eval-grade measurement as the one metric (pass rate
on a fast shard, scored by a grader as in [eval](./eval.md)). But the loop is
the point, not the comparison. If you find yourself capturing full trials,
grading them post-hoc, and comparing two runs — that's eval, not autoresearch.
Autoresearch captures *one small experiment per iteration* on a fixed budget
and decides keep/discard immediately; the trace is feedback, not an artifact.

## Going deeper

The capture primitives (`useTrace`, `sendTrace`) are reachable by resolving
the public specifier to its backing file and inspecting with the TypeScript
LSP CLI — no hardcoded source paths, so the examples survive refactors that
move impl files.

```bash
# Step 1 — resolve the specifier to its backing file (barrel)
bun -e 'console.log(Bun.resolveSync("plaited", process.cwd()+"/"))'
# → /path/to/src/main.ts

# Step 2 — read the barrel to find the backing module that exports your symbol
# The barrel re-exports: export * from './main/behavioral.ts'
#                       export type * from './main/behavioral.types.ts'
#                       export { ... } from './main/frontier-analysis.ts'
#                       export * from './main/renderer.ts'
# Pick the module that declares the symbol you need (e.g. src/main/behavioral.ts)

# Step 3 — enumerate the backing module's symbols with documentSymbol
plaited typescript-lsp '{"mode":"execute","file":"<resolved-path>","requests":[{"method":"textDocument/documentSymbol","params":{"textDocument":{"uri":"file://<resolved-path>"}}}]}'
```

Fetch any export's TSDoc with `hover` using the position from the
`documentSymbol` output. `position` is 0-indexed; get the exact line from
`documentSymbol` output (`range.start` is also 0-indexed).
