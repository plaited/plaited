## Notes on things to check

- in [playwright config](src/workshop/templates/playwright.config.template.ts) I
  need to get the server start command right.

- Reserved route`/livereload`

- npm install -g commitlint @commitlint/config-conventional

- .registry in assets is a reserved directory

- this project uses conventional commits
