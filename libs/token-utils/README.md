# @plaited/token-utils

Based on typescript types derived from the [Design Token Format](https://design-tokens.github.io/community-group/format/) this library enables JSON schema generation, generation of CSS custom properties, TS/JS mappings to CSS custom properties, and a Plaited component to deliver tokens to web applications consuming design tokens via CSS custom properties.


## New Features

- Plaited context name/value syncing up to figma
- Naming scheme should probably be automated see https://jamesiv.es/blog/frontend/design/2023/09/25/lets-chat-about-design-system-tokens#component-tokens
