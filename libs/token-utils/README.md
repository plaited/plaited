Based on typescript types derived from the [Design Token Format](https://design-tokens.github.io/community-group/format/) this library enables JSON schema generation, generation of CSS custom properties, TS/JS mappings to CSS custom properties, and a Plaited component to deliver tokens to web applications consuming design tokens via CSS custom properties.
