A door handle signals whether to pull or push:  [https://www.pexels.com/photo/semi-open-white-wooden-door-965878/](https://www.pexels.com/photo/semi-open-white-wooden-door-965878/)

**Affordances** are well known in information architecture as properties of an object that make explicit how a user can engage with an object. For example, doors have either handles to pull or flat surfaces to push. The design of the door helps people understand how to interact with it.

In the structuralist perspective of information architecture, there is another layer to affordances: affordances affect the energy output required by a person interacting with an object. Well-designed affordances tell people how to interact with objects to complete their goals in a way that decreases the energy output people have to exert using the system. This is why people feel frustrated when they push a pull door or pull a push door. Their action both breaks down their understanding of the correct action to take with a particular signifier and demanded that they exert twice the amount of energy to achieve their goals.
