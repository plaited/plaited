- APP creates a component story for every new prop
- APP requires a description for each props
- APP can suggest description for prop
- APP should visualize property list for a given component
- If a components prop has a fixed value the APP create a story for each fixed
  value
- If we have variants on a component such as a primary button and secondary
  button which are variants of a button component the APP creates a story for
  each prop for each variant
- APP requires a description for each variant
- APP can suggest description for variant
- The gathers data, preparing the data, and training a model to recognize your
  design system components
- Once the model is trained the APP exports to be loaded into our testing
  framework playwright.
- The APP creates a function will be used to capture the screenshot, load it
  into a tensor that your TensorFlow.js model can understand, and then make a
  prediction on whether the screenshot contains a design system button. If the
  visual regression test fails, you call the APP calls this helper function.
- The APP test each story for accessibility unless the accessibility check is
  disabled
- The APP modifies interaction test generated by
  [playwright codegen](https://playwright.dev/docs/codegen) to use the trigger
  method instead of deep querying structure.
- The APP organizes test into visual regression, accessibility, and interaction
  directories for each component
- The APP organizes stories into S1-S3, S4-S6
- APP should create predictable links between component stories
- APP should enable us turn on lighthouse report for component stories
- APP should support light and dark theme
- APP should allow us to safely use environmental credentials
- APP should alow us to set responsive viewport sizes to view stories at
- APP should enable us to create design tokens that can be used in components
- APP should type check design tokens
- APP should require a description for each design token
- APP can recommend description based on token name
- APP should allow us to create tokens by scale, such a typography, color, and
  size for example
- APP should allow us to apply design patterns/algorithms to those scales
- APP should allow us to say a component is an interactive island and give us an
  interface for defining triggers, rules, feedback actions, loops & modes.
- APP should require a description for each triggers, rules, feedback actions,
  loops & modes
- APP should have an understanding of Pattern language
- APP should have understanding of how to test a component built using it by
  consumer
- APP should allow component consumers to query it about system
- APP should deploy tooling to monitor usage in an organization repositories
- APP should deploy a privileged crawler to report back on usage of system
  throughout organization live apps.
- APP should deploy a tiered CLI that setups up tire2+ repos for consuming teams
- APP should be able to create S4-S6 components using LLM and information from
  design system based on query alone. serving as a starting point for consuming
  designers and developers.
- APP should be able to edit styles on a component file
- APP should be able to init a component with microinteractions and step
  backward and forward as code does not work.
- APP should enable the smart creation of alias and component tokens via
  interaction with the user interface and component code creation.

# New Approach
Import stories dynamically like i did in the old custom test
could use a promise map?
Generate test stuff like i did with personio
add  a play function to execute in playwright context
