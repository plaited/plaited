 Read @PLAITED-AGENT-PLAN.md and implement Phase 4 - Protocol Layer.

  Start with step 1: Create the folder structure and move existing files:
  - discovery/ (tool-discovery, skill-discovery, rules-discovery)
  - storage/ (semantic-cache, relation-store)
  - tools/ (file-ops, search, bash-exec + their schemas)
  - mcp/ (new)
  - adapters/ (new)
  - config/ (new)
  - infrastructure/ (start-server)

  Then proceed with config-loader.ts as step 2.
