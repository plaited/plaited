# Behavioral Agent Harness

A **minimal behavioral kernel meant to be improved.** The agent ships with an
irreducible coordination floor — the behavioral engine (`behavioral()`) plus the
agent loop (turn cycle, stop condition, compaction gate, tool dispatch bridge;
Phase 1) — and almost no policy rules. Improvement happens by composing plugins:
everything above the kernel is a plugin (`plugin.json`), and the agent grows as
behaviors (threads + handlers), tools, and skills are added to or removed from a
space. The self-improving loop (Phase 5.5) is the agent authoring candidate
behaviors/skills, verifying them, and promoting them into a space — which is
plugin mutation, observed and gated. This is the neuro-symbolic harness from
`research/talk-self-improving-agents-from-behavioral-exhaust.md`: neural
generation proposes, symbolic verification disposes, and the exhaust is the
teacher.

**Fixed floor vs. improvable surface:** the engine + the Phase 1 agent loop are
the kernel and are NOT removable plugins — without them there is no turn cycle,
no spec-event streaming, no tool dispatch. A space that could eject the turn loop
would brick the agent. The *behavioral policy* layer (guards, conventions,
space-local behaviors, skills) is minimal and improvable; the *loop machinery*
is the stable floor beneath it.

Built on the plaited behavioral runtime (`src/runtime/behavioral.ts` after
Phase -2; today `src/main/behavioral.ts`). No pi SDK. No TUI. No ACP (deferred).
The agent is a `plaited` CLI command; the dev client is pi's `!`/`!!` shell
escapes; validation is Bun test.

## Current State

The agent runs a turn end-to-end. The tools surface is complete; the kernel
floor exists; the daemon model is dropped in favor of cold invocation + gated
ingress + a plugin-shipped behavior surface.

- **Tools (`src/tools/`) — landed, all `useTool` units.** File tools (`read`,
  `bash`, `edit`, `write`, `grep`, `find`, `ls`), frontier tools
  (`frontier-replay`/`frontier-explore`/`frontier-verify`), html tools
  (`html-validate-and-escape`, `html-validate-attribute-value`, `html-render`,
  `html-update-attributes`, `html-scale-check`), and the Open Responses
  endpoint tools (`model-respond`, `model-compact`). Shared byte-accurate
  `truncate.ts`. `open-responses.schemas.ts` is the spec vocabulary (the
  daemon-era `useResponse`/`Adapter` seam is deleted).
- **Discovery (`src/tools/`) — landed, dormant pending Slice F.** `mcp-client`
  (7 modes), `skill-client` (3 modes), `discovery` (SQLite CRUD+search,
  provisioner-injected `dbPath`). Built, tested, not yet wired into
  provisioning. Pool + v2 keychain OAuth live in `src/kernel/`.
- **Kernel (`src/kernel/`) — landed.** `kernel.ts` (`createKernel`: pool,
  `dispatch` bridge, `runTurn`, shutdown-drains-pool), `dispatch.ts`
  (function_call → tool → `function_call_output`, `call_id`-correlated via
  `ueid()`, errors as data), `oauth/` (keychain + v2 provider), `threads.ts`
  (the scaffolding turn-loop thread, MINIMAL — moves into the default plugin
  once plugin-loading lands, Q3/C).
- **CLI — landed.** `plaited turn '{"space","prompt"}'` runs a turn cold and
  prints JSON (deterministic against the scripted model seam — the Harbor /
  autoresearch seam). No daemon, no TUI.
- **Harbor tasks (`tasks/`) — landed.** Two skill-authoring tasks
  (`build-git-context-skill`, `build-typescript-lsp-skill`) for the
  autoresearch loop; agent authors + installs an AgentSkills skill at
  `.agents/skills/<name>`, verifier recomputes truth from fixtures → fractional
  `reward.json`. Validated on docker + Daytona.
- **Skills — consolidating.** `skills/` → single `behavioral` skill (Q2).
  `.agents/skills` is a symlink to `skills/`.
- **Decisions this session (2026-09-07, see Decision Log):** no daemon + gated
  ingress (Q1); default plugin ships one `behavioral` skill (Q2); threads are
  a first-class plugin component under `threads/` + `extensions."sh.behavioral"`
  (Q3); skill gating default-allow host-side (Q4); generative-UI dev server
  (Q5); space = project folder, isolation invariant (Q6). Phase 6 rewritten to
  cold invocation + gated ingress + dev server.
- **In-flight / next (the autoresearch loop prerequisites, Q8/E, in order):**
  (1) fill the default plugin content (`plugin.json` `sh.behavioral` extension
  + `mcp.json` you-web); (2) author the real **core thread** in `threads/` (the
  loop's subject); (3) kernel primitives to run an arbitrary thread + capture
  the trace/exhaust per run; (4) define the task-success metric (Q8/C,
  RESOLVED — Q8/F); (5) install `@daytonaio/sdk` + provision OpenRouter. Then
  the autoresearch loop script (Q8/A). Also still open: the public-event
  ingress registry (Q1/B); Slice F (provision discovery primitives); the dev
  server (Q5).
- **Known pre-existing test failures (not from recent work):** controller
  specs (Playwright browser-launch timeouts in this env). The
  `match-listener.spec.ts:596` `prefixItems` failure is **resolved** — it was
  an AJV strict-mode tuple-compile rejection (bare `prefixItems` without
  `minItems`/`maxItems` disambiguates to `add_thread_error`, so the consumer
  thread was rejected wholesale, not a runtime matching bug as previously
  guessed). Fix: close the tuple with `minItems`/`maxItems`.


## Decision Log

### 2026-09-09 — Autoresearch loop: shape + prerequisites

- Q8/A — **The eval loop is an autoresearch loop, not a one-off demo.** The
  reusable Daytona script IS the autoresearch loop (generate → `frontier-verify`
  in an isolated forked sandbox → promote/discard → log exhaust). The talk demo
  is one narrated run of it. Karpathy-autoresearch shape: one mutable surface
  (the thread/skill), a fixed evaluator, a keep/discard rule, loop forever.
- Q8/B — **The gate is a proof, not a scalar metric.** Karpathy's gate is a
  metric (`val_bpb`); ours is `frontier-verify` — a symbolic deadlock/livelock
  proof. "Neural proposes, symbolic disposes"; self-modification can't break
  confluence. Anti-reward-hacking is free (the evaluator is a pure function of
  thread data, not agent-editable).
- Q8/C — **A second signal is required beyond safety.** `frontier-verify`
  proves a thread can't deadlock/livelock; it does not prove the thread
  *accomplishes its task*. The loop needs a task-success metric alongside the
  safety gate, or it optimizes safety without usefulness. OPEN — the metric is
  undefined (see Open Questions).
- Q8/D — **Generators are swappable: scripted first, then OpenRouter model.**
  (a) a scripted generator (deterministic, proves the loop mechanics) as
  scaffolding; (b) a `model-respond` generator via an OpenRouter endpoint
  (provisioner-injected key, the `provider` routing field). OpenRouter's
  Responses-spec conformance must be verified at build time; if it doesn't
  conform, a thin adapter or a spec-conformant provider is needed.
- Q8/E — **Prerequisites before the loop script** (dependency order): (1) fill
  the default plugin content (`plugin.json` `sh.behavioral` extension +
  `mcp.json` you-web) so the loader has something real to load; (2) author the
  real **core thread** in `threads/` (the loop's subject — not the MINIMAL
  scaffolding `TURN_LOOP_THREAD`); (3) kernel primitives to run an *arbitrary*
  thread (today `runTurn` is hardcoded to `TURN_LOOP_THREAD`) and to capture
  the trace/exhaust per run; (4) define the second signal (Q8/C); (5) install
  `@daytonaio/sdk` + provision OpenRouter. Then the loop script.
- Q8/F — **The task-success metric (Q8/C) is resolved.** Per-candidate
  keep/discard gate: `frontier-verify` (safety — no deadlock/livelock) AND
  `frontier-replay` over a reference trace reaches the target frontier
  (usefulness). Both pure functions of thread data. A Harbor task eval is the
  outer task-level signal (later). This is the autoresearch "fixed metric" —
  the loop is a hill-climb gated on proof, not a scalar score.

### 2026-09-07 — Generative-UI dev server (no TUI); space semantics

- Q5/A — **The local UI is a dev server, not a TUI, and it is part of the
  agent's space.** `plaited` (cold CLI) spins up (or reuses) a local dev
  server built on `src/controller/` + `src/tools/html.ts`. It serves SSR pages
  over WebSocket (the controller's existing push model: server-pushed
  `render`/`attrs`, DOM-bound `b-trigger`/`b-form`, `ui_event` back to the
  agent). The agent renders into it via `html-render` / `html-update-attributes`
  — the UI is a space the agent acts on, not a separate app it points at.
- Q5/B — **The dev server hosts a memory + shared human-agent context UI.** A
  human selects a space to work in and collaborates with the agent there;
  because the agent drives the UI generatively, the human can ask the agent to
  reshape the UI itself. Events transmit over WebSocket; agent-initiated
  content reaches the page via event emission captured by `useTrace` and
  pushed up to the page. (Mechanics are a later phase — this records the
  shape, not the build.)
- Q6/A — **A space is a project folder (local).** No multi-session: the space
  *is* the project. One `plaited` invocation works in one space; the space's
  context persists across invocations (Phase 4 persistence), so the project
  folder is the durable identity.
- Q6/B — **Space isolation is invariant across deployment shapes.** Spaces
  can't see or query each other — they only respond to their own events via
  `useAddThread`/`useTrigger` space-scoping. Root sees everything because it's
  unscoped. The atproto deployment shape (root space = server, spaces =
  atproto spaces, space↔space exchange triggers the agent) is a later phase
  built on the local model — noted, not committed.

### 2026-09-07 — No daemon; gated event ingress

- Q1/A — **Drop the daemon model entirely.** `plaited` is a normal cold CLI
  agent (JSON-in/JSON-out, no TUI) — the same interface the autoresearch loop
  and Harbor tasks drive. There is no warm/serve process. External actors that
  want the agent (a cron job, an atproto space event, Harbor) invoke `plaited`
  per trigger; the agent runs to turn-end and exits. If you want a recurring
  job, write a cron job (Bun) that calls the agent — don't keep the agent
  resident.
- Q1/B — **Ingress is gated by a public-event registry, not open.** External
  events must not trigger arbitrary types. A store holds a CRUD-able list of
  allowed public events — each entry `{ type, space, schema }` (the JSON Schema
  the event's detail must satisfy). An external trigger is admitted only if its
  type+space is registered and its detail validates against the registered
  schema; unauthorized or malformed events are rejected at the boundary. This
  is the trust boundary between the outside world and the behavioral space.
  (Store: reuse the discovery-sqlite pattern — a local, regenerable store the
  kernel reads at admission time.)

### 2026-09-07 — Threads are a first-class plugin component (not skill assets)

- Q3/A — **Threads are their own plugin component, not skill assets.** The
  default plugin (agent-plugins spec) carries a `threads/` folder as a peer of
  `skills/`. Threads are kernel-facing behavioral registrations, not
  model-consumed skill content, so they must not live in a skill's `assets/`
  (which the Agent Skills spec reserves for model-readable static files).
- Q3/B — **Threads are declared via the plaited client-extension namespace.**
  Per the Agent Plugins spec, `plugin.json` is a closed schema — custom
  component types go under `extensions`. The default plugin declares its
  threads under `extensions."sh.behavioral"` with a manifest that maps each
  thread file to the space it applies to (per the earlier space-scoping
  design). A top-level `threads/` directory holds the thread files
  (a plain component dir, not the namespace-named extension dir).
- Q3/C — **`src/kernel/threads.ts` is a placeholder for the kernel's own
  floor**, not the home of behavior. Behavior threads ship in plugins under
  `threads/`; the kernel loads them at provisioning. The scaffolding turn-loop
  thread currently in `threads.ts` moves into the default plugin once the
  plugin-loading path exists.

### 2026-09-09 — Spec-conformant plugin; loader becomes a conformant client

- Q3/C-REVISED — **The core framework turn-loop thread stays in
  `src/kernel/threads.ts`** (overrides the Q3/C "moves into the default
  plugin" note). The default plugin's `threads/` is for plugin-shipped
  behavior, not the kernel's own loop.
- Q7/A — **`plugin.json` is spec-conformant (Agent Plugins v1), not the
  custom loader manifest.** It carries only the closed portable fields
  (`$schema`, `name`, `version`, …, `extensions`). MCPs live in `mcp.json`;
  skills are discovered from `skills/`; neither is declared in `plugin.json`.
  The earlier `PluginManifestSchema` shape (`{mcps, skills, models, threads}`)
  is superseded — plaited is a *conformant client*, not a custom format.
- Q7/B — **Plaited-owned declarations live under the `sh.behavioral` client
  extension** (the spec's sanctioned mechanism — the spec does not prescribe
  enablement, trust policy, or client-extension behavior). Under
  `extensions."sh.behavioral"`: `threads` (thread file → space mapping), `models`
  (Open Responses endpoints — not a portable component type, so client-owned),
  and `spaces` (per-space config).
- Q7/C — **Per-space gating is declared in `sh.behavioral.spaces` and applies to
  MCPs and skills alike** (and tools), default-allow per Q4. Declaring which
  MCP tools/skills a space may use under `extensions."sh.behavioral"` is
  client-specific config — fully compliant. `mcp.json` says which servers
  *exist*; `sh.behavioral.spaces` says which a space *may use*.
- Q7/D — **`plugin-loader` is reworked into a conformant client**: validate the
  spec `plugin.json` + `mcp.json`, discover `skills/` from the fixed location,
  read the `sh.behavioral` extension for `threads`/`models`/`spaces`. Enforce
  conformance (reject fatal manifest violations) rather than merely tolerate
  the shape — the conformant-client claim should be real.

### 2026-09-09 — The `sh.behavioral` extension schema (root + space mirror)

> **Namespace:** `sh.behavioral` — the reverse-domain of `behavioral.sh`, which
> the project controls. Renamed from `com.plaited` (2026-09-09). Spec §8: the
> extension namespace MUST be a reverse-domain identifier and SHOULD be a
> domain the client controls — both hold.

- Q7/E — **`extensions."sh.behavioral"` shape.** Root carries `models`, `mcps`,
  `skills`, `threads`, and `spaces`. `mcps`/`skills`/`threads` are
  `{ include?: string[], exclude?: string[] }` gating objects; `models` is an
  array of endpoint declarations `{ provider, modelId, endpointUrl, apiKeyRef?,
  locality? }`; `spaces.<name>` mirrors the same shape and overrides root for
  the keys it sets (unset keys inherit root's default-allow posture).
- Q7/F — **Threads are discovered from a top-level `threads/` dir** (a plain
  component dir, not the namespace-named `sh.behavioral/` extension dir — the
  spec fixes only `skills/` and `mcp.json`). `threads.include`/`exclude` are
  paths into `threads/`; absent means everything in `threads/` is in scope.
- Q7/G — **Gating rule: allowlist-first-then-exclude.** `include` (when set)
  narrows to its members; `exclude` then subtracts. Applies uniformly to
  mcps, skills, threads. Absent both → allow-all (Q4 posture).
- Q7/H — **Models are declared at root, gated per space.** Root declares the
  available model fleet; a space's `models` selects the subset it may route
  to — a space cannot declare a brand-new endpoint (prevents arbitrary
  model/credential usage from a space).

### 2026-09-07 — Skill gating: default-allow, list-narrows (matches MCP semantics)

- Q4/A — **Skills are gated host-side at provisioning with the same
  allow/blocklist pattern as tools/MCPs** (`skills` / `excludeSkills` per
  space config), **defaulting to allow-all**. If neither list is set, every
  skill a plugin provides is enabled. `skills` set → allowlist (only these).
  `excludeSkills` set → blocklist (all but these). Both set → allowlist first,
  then blocklist subtracts. The absent-means-on posture keeps a space config
  minimal and auditable: lists appear only when restricting.
- Q4/B — **Gating is host policy, not plugin self-description.** The plugin
  declares what it provides; the host (kernel/provisioning thread, per the
  operator's space config) decides what each space enables. Authoritative
  allow/deny lives host-side, applied per space. This extends the existing
  packs model (plan.md "Packs + useBehavioral + skills": `$root`/space packs
  carry `tools`/`excludeTools` + `skills`/`excludeSkills`) — Q4 confirms it
  rather than inventing a new mechanism, and fixes the posture to
  default-allow.

### 2026-09-07 — Default plugin ships one skill: `behavioral`

- Q2/A — **The default plugin consolidates to a single skill, renamed
  `behavioral`.** `skills/plaited-framework/` becomes `skills/behavioral/`
  (SKILL.md + its references: behavioral, frontier-analysis, controller,
  renderer, eval, okf, autoresearch, design-spec). It is the one skill the
  default plugin carries — the guide to working in/on the plaited behavioral
  harness.
- Q2/B — **The other skills leave the repo.** `git-context`, `markdown`,
  `typescript-lsp` skills are gone from `skills/` (their role is now Harbor
  challenge content in `tasks/`). `mcp-client` skill is gone (its code became
  `src/tools/mcp-client.ts`). `design` is dropped (generic doc-authoring, not
  plaited-specific).
- Q2/C — **Default plugin layout** (agent-plugins spec): `plugin.json` +
  `skills/behavioral/` + `threads/` (Q3) + `mcp.json`. Threads are declared
  under `extensions."sh.behavioral"` mapping thread file → space.

### 2026-09-07 — MCP/skill discovery: search-mediated progressive disclosure

Unified architecture for surfacing remote MCP tools and local skills to the
agent. Both domains follow the agentskills.io three-tier progressive-
disclosure pattern (catalog → full instructions → bundled resources), but
**search-on-demand** replaces the spec's recommended static catalog-in-system-
prompt. The model searches a SQLite store by description, picks a candidate,
then loads full info through the relevant client tool. This scales to large /
dynamic pools without rebuilding a static catalog per session, at the cost of
one search round-trip before activation — and the orchestration moves into
kernel behavioral threads, which is the plan's intended shape (tools are dumb
primitives, threads orchestrate).

The spec deviation (search-on-demand vs static catalog) is **deliberate**, not
an oversight to "fix" later by adding a catalog "for simplicity."

**Three stateless built-in `src/tools/` units, all take their target as input**
(no tool owns shared discovery data; no tool calls another tool):

- **`mcp-client`** — Phase 3 conversion of the existing CLI to `useTool`. Seven
  modes survive (`call-tool`/`list-tools`/`list-prompts`/`get-prompt`/
  `list-resources`/`read-resource`/`discover`). Input `{mode, url, tool, args,
  auth, ...}`. Returns remote MCP data only — never writes a store.
- **`skill-client`** (new) — reimplemented from the agentskills.io spec +
  `src/cli/markdown.ts` as **reference only** (no import, no export-helpers
  refactor; own frontmatter parsing). Modes: `discover` (scan
  `.agents/skills/` project + user level, parse frontmatter → records),
  `read-skill` (load SKILL.md body), `list-resources` (enumerate bundled files).
- **`discovery`** (new) — `{mode, dbPath, ...}`. Full CRUD + search over
  `.plaited/discovery.sqlite` (`bun:sqlite`), unified `kind: 'mcp-tool' | 'skill'`
  rows. **The only tool that touches the store file.** Population, refresh, and
  search are kernel-thread policy via this tool — not adapter provisioning.

**Adapter role narrows to the pi-extension pattern** (connection pool + OAuth +
tardown), matching `youdotcom-oss/minimax-m3-deepsearchqa-skill-eval`'s
`extension.ts`: a live `Client` per server-url lazily connected and reused across
calls, `close()`d on teardown. The adapter owns **no discovery data**.

**MCP SDK clarification:** the 2024-09-03 "Drop MCP SDK" decision was about the
**server** side (`new McpServer`, `use-mcp-server.ts`, dropped in favor of
AJV/`useTool`). The **client** SDK stays — `Client`,
`StreamableHTTPClientTransport`, `OAuthClientProvider` from
`@modelcontextprotocol/client`. This is consistent with "the agent uses MCP to
talk to remote servers" and does not contradict the AJV/`useTool` local-tool
story.

**OAuth:** `BunKeychainOAuthProvider` (per the sketch) — refresh tokens and
client info to `Bun.secrets` (OS keychain) instead of the current
`~/.plaited/mcp/tokens/<host>.json` file persistence. **Upgrade to the v2
`OAuthClientProvider` shape** (issuer-keyed `clientInformation(ctx)`,
`state()`/`saveDiscoveryState`/`discoveryState()`, `validateResourceURL`) — the
current `createOAuthProvider` implements the old interface and lacks RFC 9207
`iss` validation and issuer-binding. One provider per server-url, reused across
process restarts (keychain persists; the connection doesn't, but reconnect
reads tokens back).

**Surfacing:** neither single-tool nor multi-tool — search-mediated, on-demand.
The Phase 2/7 "built-in tools only, packs never contribute tools" invariant
stays intact: remote MCP tools are never registered as first-class tools.

**`use-plugin-adaptert.ts` → `use-plugin-adapter.ts`** rename (file is empty).

**Discovery store is NOT git-backed** — local SQLite, just what the tool allows.
Distinct from Phase 4's git-backed trace-log persistence. The store is
regenerable (re-scan filesystem, re-discover servers); committing it bloats the
repo and risks staleness.

### 2024-09-03 — Build sequence: tools → lock runtime → small kernel

- **Sequence:** (1) finish `src/tools/` (MCP `useMCPServer` tools), (2) lock
  the runtime, (3) build a small kernel that completes the agent harness.
- **The behavioral core IS the loop.** The super-step
  (`computeFrontier → selectNextEvent → publish`) is the agent turn cycle — no
  separate `runLoop`. The kernel is thin: set up the program, register the fixed
  tool set, wire `useTrace` as the action channel, feed `user.prompt` in.
- **`useTrace` async callback = the action channel** (replaces `useAddHandler`).
  The engine does NOT await listeners (`behavioral.ts:28`, `void Promise.resolve(...)`
  — non-awaiting by design). The action listener does its async work outside the
  super-step and re-enters the result via `trigger`. The program synchronizes on
  the *event*, not on the listener completing — a thread with `waitFor: ['T']`
  yields; the listener fires, does I/O, `trigger`s `T` back; the next super-step
  selects it. The behavioral core stays synchronous/deterministic; async I/O is
  off to the side.
- **Kernel shape:** MCP tool approach (tools are `useMCPServer` registrations),
  controlled by behavioral threads, uses the `transform` idiom.
- **Model-as-tool.** `request({ type: 'respond' })` → action listener calls
  `useResponse` → triggers each stream event verbatim into the space. The model
  is one tool in the fixed set, not special.
- **`transform` idiom = the declarative synchronous reshape** (query → target,
  no I/O). Pure-data counterpart to the action listener: `transform` for
  reshaping, action listeners for I/O side effects. Both re-enter via the event
  stream.
- **Fixed tool set + threads + triggers = extension surface.** Tools are
  built-in/fixed; behavior is threads; ingress is triggers. No new tools, no
  handlers.
- **`onSelection` is test-only.** The `useTrace` + selection-filter helper in
  `src/main/tests/helpers.ts` is NOT the engine API and NOT the design direction
  for `src/agent/`. How `useTrace` is consumed agent-side is undecided; do not
  bake it into docs or the kernel.
- **Doc/skill handler-mention updates deferred.** Stale `useAddHandler`/
  `useFeedback`/`feedback_error` references should NOT be rewritten to describe
  a `useTrace`-replacement story yet — that story is undecided. Pure *removal* of
  provably-dead references is safe; replacing with an un-landed design is
  speculative.
- **Resolved: no engine error mechanism needed.** Split listener failures into
  two classes: (1) tool/I/O failures (bash non-zero, model error, remote MCP
  down) are *expected runtime outcomes* that return as **data** (`isError`,
  terminal error event) — the kernel's action listener catches these and
  `trigger`s a `T.error` event the program can `waitFor`/`block` on (kernel
  convention, ~5 lines, not an engine feature); (2) genuine listener bugs
  (uncaught throw) are rare because the kernel owns the listeners, they're
  typed, and they're tested — the engine's `console.error` swallow
  (`behavioral.ts:32`) is acceptable for this tail (surface to log, fix with a
  test). The user-extensible surfaces sidestep uncaught-throw risk: remote MCPs
  return `isError` data, skills are prose, threads are gated by `verifyFrontiers`.
  So `feedback_error` has no successor at the engine layer; the error path is a
  kernel convention.

### 2024-09-03 — Drop MCP SDK; runtime internal-only; frontier-analysis → src/tools/

- **Q2 — `src/main.ts` deleted permanently.** The runtime is internal to the
  harness, not a published library. The package has no public entry point;
  `behavioral()` is importable only by internal paths (controller, tools, the
  future kernel). Matches "the agent is a `plaited` CLI command, the runtime is
  internal." Not provisional — committed.
- **Q1 — Drop the MCP SDK (`@modelcontextprotocol/*`) in favor of an AJV /
  `defineTool`-style registrar.** The SDK is currently ceremony with no live
  consumer — `use-mcp-server.ts` is a 3-line pass-through, and `new McpServer`
  appears only in a test's in-memory transport; nothing in `bin/` or `src/agent/`
  serves a server. The plan's Phase 2 already specified the target shape
  (`defineTool` taking a `ToolArgs` data object with JSON Schema, validated by
  AJV); the `useMCPServer` drift moved away from it. Dropping the SDK returns to
  the plan. The tool *data* (name, inputSchema, outputSchema, description, run)
  survives the swap; only the `server.registerTool` wrapper changes. MCP wire
  protocol is deferred to a Phase 7 adapter if remote tool execution needs it —
  tool definitions won't change, only the serving layer. This resolves the
  "tool wiring drift" open question.
- **Q3 — Move `src/main/frontier-analysis.ts` into `src/tools/`.** The runtime
  does NOT import it (verified: `behavioral.ts`/`behavioral.utils.ts`/
  `behavioral.types.ts`/`behavioral.constants.ts` have zero refs). The dep runs
  the other way: `frontier-analysis.ts` imports FROM the runtime. Its only
  non-test consumer is the `verify_frontiers` tool. So moving it next to its
  consumer reflects the true dep direction, not an inversion. The gate (now
  removed) was the only thing that ever pulled it into the engine.

### 2024-09-03 — Gate moves out of the engine into the kernel

- **Decision: the registration gate does NOT live in the engine.** Revert the
  `useAddThread` gate added earlier this session (`behavioral.ts:272-293`):
  `verifyFrontiers` is removed from `useAddThread`; the engine goes back to
  `validateThread → generateRulesFunctions → useThread → running.add`, with
  `add_thread_error` only on schema-invalid / actual exceptions.
- **Rationale:** (1) the plan already said this — Phase 5.5 Layer 1: "Lives in
  `src/agent/`, not the engine — the engine stays domain-agnostic and must not
  pay exploration cost per `useAddThread`." The in-engine gate was drift. (2)
  Moving the gate to the kernel enables **configurable `maxDepth` + retry on
  `truncated`** (the whole point of moving it) instead of a hardcoded `maxDepth:
  10` magic number. (3) The engine calling an MCP *tool* would invert the
  dependency (engine → `src/tools/`); the kernel calls the `verifyFrontiers`
  **function** in-process before `useAddThread` — no protocol round-trip.
- **Coverage:** `src/main/tests/add-thread-gate.spec.ts` is now dead — it tests
  engine gating that no longer exists. Delete it; coverage moves to a kernel
  test when the kernel gate lands.
- **`verify_frontiers` tool stays.** It is the external surface for the
  autoresearch loop; the kernel calls the function directly.

### 2024-09-03 — Frontier gate + verify_frontiers tool

- **One tool, verdict-only.** `verify_frontiers` exposes `verifyFrontiers`
  over the process edge returning `{ status, findings, livelocks, report }`.
  No `computeThreadReward`/`threadGateReward` scalar wrapper — it's RL cargo the
  no-fine-tuning premise jettisons (a scalar exists to feed a gradient; with no
  gradient the agent maps `status → keep/discard` in its own loop), it bakes a
  `truncated` policy the tool deliberately leaves to the caller, and it's a
  pass-through rename of one expression (Runtime Wiring Style violation).
- **Runtime gate policy: positive-proof only.** `useAddThread` admits only on
  `verdict.status === 'verified'`; both `failed` and `truncated` are rejected
  via `!== 'verified'`. No budget-escalation retry at the runtime layer — a
  kernel registration path must not loop on `maxDepth` escalation. The tool,
  by contrast, returns `report.truncated` so an agent autoresearch caller can
  retry `truncated` variants with a higher `maxDepth` (caller policy, not gate
  policy). Two layers, coherent: runtime = strict guardrail, tool = flexible
  surface.
- **Reuse the `add_thread_error` trace kind, enrich the payload.** No new trace
  kind for gate rejection — `add_thread_error` already has `error: unknown[]`,
  which carries `{ code, findings, livelocks, report }`. Schema stays; the
  discriminator moves inside the `error` array.
- **`progress` = event types, not thread labels.** `findLivelocks` matches
  `progress` against `edge.selection.type`. The tool's `progress` describe text
  reads "Event types that count as progress" (code is source of truth).
- **Trust boundary via `validateThread`, not zod.** The tool's zod input makes
  `rules` optional so the MCP framework doesn't reject before the handler runs;
  the AJV `validateThread` (full `IdiomSchema`) is the authoritative boundary
  validator, returning `{ isError, errors }` as structured output.
- **`ok: z.boolean()` + optional verdict fields.** One `outputSchema` covers
  success (`ok:true` + verdict) and error (`ok:false` + `isError`/`message`)
  paths; success vs error is discriminated by `isError`/`ok`, not by schema
  shape (matches `binary.ts`; a `z.discriminatedUnion` was considered but
  rejected for consistency with the existing tool pattern).
- **`once: true` is the verified-fixture idiom.** A looping `request`/`waitFor`
  thread without `once` livelocks under `progress: [label]` (label ≠ the
  requested event, so re-requesting makes no labeled progress). `once: true`
  is also the `deadlock.spec.ts` pattern. Test fixtures for verified threads
  must carry `once: true` or use a non-cyclic rule.
- **`messages` is not exposed by the tool.** The exploration trace prefix is an
  internal `Trace[]` shape an agent caller can't supply over JSON; the tool
  always calls `verifyFrontiers` with `messages: []`.
- **`truncated` is reachable at the self-check tier (resolved empirically).**
  `progress: [label]` only converts *cyclic* would-be-truncations into
  livelock-`failed`; an acyclic-but-deep chain (15 sync points, `once: true`)
  truncates at `maxDepth: 10` with zero findings/livelocks. The gate's
  `!== 'verified'` has two reachable branches — `failed` and `truncated` — both
  covered by `add-thread-gate.spec.ts`. The `truncated`-rejection branch is
  genuine defense-in-depth, not dead code.

### 2024-09-02 — Handler lifecycle

- `disconnect` removed from `Handler<T>` params. Side-effect channel must not
  mutate the listener registry mid-dispatch. Caller-held `Disconnect` is the
  sole removal path (`plan.md` Phase -1).

### 2024-09-02 — defineTool + kernel + spec-valid items

- `useTool` → `defineTool`. Factory is an internal utility in `src/agent/`,
  takes JSON Schema (not Zod), wires only the handler. `ToolDescriptor` type
  lives alongside it.
- `BLOCK_INVALID_TOOL_CALL_THREAD` guard thread removed then **restored**.
  Dispatch-time validation in `kernel.ts` is the sole *schema* gate; the guard
  is defense-in-depth at the tool's own trust boundary (full-envelope block on
  `{ call_id, arguments: inputSchema }` with `detailMatch: 'invalid'`).
- `function_call_output` is now spec-valid: fresh `id` via `ueid()`, `status`
  `'completed'|'failed'`, `call_id` correlation. Per the Open Responses spec
  "Required item fields."
- Tool event detail is a private harness contract `{ call_id, arguments,
  item_id }`, not a spec item shape. `kernel.ts` owns spec-item construction.
- `threads.ts` → `kernel.ts`, `registerAgentThreads` → `registerKernel`.
  The file is the agent kernel, not just "a file of threads."

### 2024-09-02 — Packs + useBehavioral + skills

- Tools are built-in only. Packs never contribute tools — they contribute
  threads + handlers via `useBehavioral`.
- The `packs` object in `plugin.json` maps scopes (`$root` + spaces) to
  behavior-file paths + built-in tool allow/exclude lists + skills
  allow/exclude lists.
- `useBehavioral` is a pure identity wrapper (consumer-side). The harness
  provisioning handler curries scoped hooks and AST-checks agent-generated
  behavior files. Foundation for the self-improving loop (Phase 5.5).
- `provisionDefaults` to dissolve into the kernel's provisioning handler
  (event-driven, not imperative boot). Built-in tools become imports the
  handler iterates for `$root`. **Pending: not yet implemented.**

## Open Questions

- **The autoresearch loop's task-success metric (Q8/C) — RESOLVED (2026-09-09).**
  The per-candidate keep/discard gate is **`frontier-verify` (safety) AND
  `frontier-replay` over a reference trace reaching the target frontier
  (usefulness)** — both pure functions of thread data (deterministic, no model
  in the gate), making the loop a true hill-climb. A Harbor task eval is the
  outer task-level check (later, not blocking the per-candidate gate). See
  Decision Log Q8/F.

- **Discovery tool schema + kernel progressive-disclosure thread shape.** The
  three tools' mode/input schemas (`mcp-client` 7 modes, `skill-client` 3 modes,
  `discovery` CRUD+search) and the behavioral thread that drives the
  search→pick→load loop still need concrete specification before
  implementation. Order: schemas first (they're the tool contracts), then the
  thread. **Schemas RESOLVED (2026-09-07, Phase 3.5 Slices A–E):** all three
  tools landed as `useTool` units with hand-written AJV `oneOf` discriminated
  unions on `mode` (cast through `unknown` as `JSONSchemaType` — read.ts/
  frontier.ts precedent; no Zod). The behavioral thread is the remaining
  deferred work (Phase 3.5 Slice F, recorded below).
- **`mcp-client`/`markdown` CLI→`useTool` conversion + adapter pool** is the
  Phase 3 conversion deliverable (resolved above); the discovery store +
  `skill-client` + `discovery` tool is net-new — new phase (**Phase 3.5**,
  resolved 2026-09-07; Slices A–E delivered, Slice F deferred).
- **Tool wiring drift — RESOLVED (2024-09-03).** MCP SDK dropped. Tool
  convention is `useTool` (`src/tools/use-tool.ts`): a factory taking
  `{ name, description, inputSchema, outputSchema, run }` where each tool writes
  a concrete `type Input` / `type Output` and annotates
  `inputSchema: JSONSchemaType<Input>` / `outputSchema: JSONSchemaType<Output>`
  — the `behavioral.types.ts` pattern extended to tools. The generic `TInput`
  threads the already-checked type into `run`'s param (no `as` cast at the
  trust boundary). `run` also receives a `validate` object (compiled AJV
  validators for input/output) for handlers that want runtime re-validation;
  currently unused by `ls.ts`. Error path: optional `message?`/`isError?`
  fields on `Output` (same object, not a union — matches `binary.ts`/
  `verify-frontiers.ts`; `JSONSchemaType<Output>` over a union breaks ajv's
  inference, optionals don't). `ls.ts` is the reference conversion; `find.ts`
  (has a `glob`/`pattern` duplicate-schema drift bug the new shape kills) is
  the next conversion target. Phase 5.5 Layer 2 text specified `defineTool`;
  the landed name is `useTool` but the shape matches — minor phase-text fold
  pending.
- **Where does the `ToolDescriptor` dispatch registry live when provisioning
  moves inside the kernel?** Likely the `registerKernel` closure, populated by
  the provisioning handler, read by the `respond` handler — same as today, just
  populated differently. Needs confirmation.
- **How does the provisioning handler get triggered?** `space.created`?
  `plugin.loaded`? Both? What's the ingress event, and who emits it?
- **Does the provisioning handler also handle the `tools`/`excludeTools`
  filtering, or does that happen before the tool list reaches the handler?**
- **How does the small kernel consume `useTrace`?** Direction set (2024-09-03):
  `useTrace` async callbacks ARE the action channel — a listener filtered on a
  selected event type does the side effect and `trigger`s results back; the
  program `waitFor`s the result event, not the listener. **Open sub-questions:**
  (a) how the fixed MCP tool set (`useMCPServer` registrations) is invoked from
  the action listener — does the kernel map selection→MCP-call→trigger, or are
  tools invoked more directly; (b) does the model-stream tool trigger each
  stream event as it arrives (preserving the spec-events-verbatim invariant) or
  batch.
- **Renderer/HTML tool: this pass or Phase 7 pack?** A stateless HTML transform
  tool (caller passes HTML each call) is a clean `src/tools/` shape if the
  Renderer class collapses to pure functions. But the plan routes rendering
  through the Phase 7 pack seam. `html-rewriter.utils.ts` validators stay
  library imports either way (pass-through wrapper = Runtime-Wiring-Style
  violation).
- **Does the `Renderer`/`html-rewriter.utils.ts` move belong in this tool pass,
  or stay a Phase 7 pack-wrapped surface?** A stateless HTML transform tool
  (caller passes the HTML string each call) is a clean `src/tools/` shape if
  the Renderer class is collapsed to pure functions. But the plan routes
  rendering through the Phase 7 pack seam, not built-in `src/tools/`. Decide
  before Phase -2 relocation: collapse the class + add a built-in tool, or move
  to `src/ui/` as a library and wrap in a pack later. `html-rewriter.utils.ts`
  validators stay library imports in either case (pass-through wrapper =
  Runtime-Wiring-Style violation).

## Phases

**Cross-cutting conventions for every phase:**

- Repo rules in `AGENTS.md` apply (Bun APIs, conventional commits, `test` not `it`,
  no `any`, Zod `.parse()` at trust boundaries, minimal-implementation directive).
- TDD: write the test first; one runnable check minimum per non-trivial logic.
- The behavioral engine's public API is `behavioral()` →
  `{ useAddThread, useTrigger, useAddHandler, useTrace, sendTrace, useEject }` —
  partially applied by **space** (formerly `topic`; see Phase -1). Threads are plain
  data: `{ label, rules: Idioms[], once?: true }`.
- Listeners match on `type` + optional `detailSchema` (JSON Schema, Ajv2020-compiled)
  + `detailMatch: 'valid'|'invalid'`. Handlers match on `type` only (space-scoped via
  partial application).
- The engine lives in `src/runtime/` after Phase -2; all harness code lands in
  `src/agent/`; the render/protocol layer (`src/ui/`) is out of the agent's import
  surface and becomes a pack-wrapped tool later.
- Tools are **built-in only** (wired via `defineTool` in `src/tools/`, Phase 2).
  Packs never contribute tools — they contribute threads + handlers via the
  `useBehavioral` consumer interface (Phase 7). The engine sketch that
  lived at `src/main/behavioral.ts` lines ~400-423 was abandoned (reverted).

---

## Phase -2 — Repo restructure: `src/runtime/`, `src/agent/`, `src/ui/`

**Goal:** the source tree matches the architecture before any agent code lands.
Today `src/main/` flattens the behavioral engine, frontier analysis, renderer,
swap-boundary, and css/html/message schemas into one surface (`src/main.ts`
re-exports all of it). An agent authoring threads needs only the coordination
kernel — the UI machinery is a future tool, not a library import.

**Deliverables:**

- `git mv` restructure:
  - `src/runtime/` ← `behavioral.*` (engine, schemas, types, constants, utils) +
    `frontier-analysis.ts`. The gate needs frontier analysis and it shares types
    with the engine (`replayToFrontier` imports `PendingBid` etc.) — one unit, not
    a separate top-level dir.
  - `src/agent/` ← new home for the harness (Phases 0–6 land here).
  - `src/ui/` ← `renderer.ts`, `swap-boundary.ts`, `html-rewriter.utils.ts`,
    `css.*`, `html.*`, `message.*` — the render/protocol layer. Stays importable
    (`src/controller.ts` consumes the message protocol at SSR time); becomes a
    becomes a pack-wrapped tool later (Phase 7) without another move.
  (`src/tools/define-tool.ts` is the built-in tool wiring utility; the UI layer
  is not a pack-contributed tool — packs contribute threads + handlers only.)
  - `src/cli/` mostly dissolves: `git-context`, `markdown`, `mcp-client`,
    `typescript-lsp` become `defineTool` units (Phase 3) living in `src/tools/`.
    What survives is the entry (`bin/plaited.ts`) and the `makeCli` machinery that
    Phase 6's input parsing / `--schema` surface still uses — relocate that residue
    to `src/agent/` or a minimal `src/cli.ts`; the directory goes away.
- `src/main.ts` shrinks to re-exporting `src/runtime/` only — the public surface
  for thread-authors and pack-authors.
- `package.json` exports: `"."` → `src/main.ts` (runtime), `"./ui"` →
  `src/ui.ts` boundary, `"./controller"` and `"./utils"` unchanged.
- File-naming per AGENTS.md: module-prefixed files keep their prefixes under
  `runtime/` (`behavioral.schemas.ts` etc.); the directory provides context.

**Done when:** `bun --bun tsc --noEmit` clean; full `bun test` suite passes with only
import-path changes; `src/main.ts` exports nothing from `ui/`; no file contents
change beyond import paths.

---

## Phase -1 — Engine: `topic` → `space` rename, declared spaces, `useEject`

**Goal:** spaces (the spatiotemporal paper's spatial axis; vocabulary aligned with
atproto spaces) become first-class: a space groups threads + handlers + tools, binds
are validated, and orchestration code can eject a whole space. Motivation:
`research/Spatiotemporal-Composability-for-AI-Agent-Extensions.md` and the branching
work in Phase 4.

**Design (decided):**

- **A space is just a string identifier.** The engine knows nothing about atproto,
  DIDs, authorities, or tenancy — all of that is expressible as handlers/threads
  bound to a space (e.g. an atproto pack registering a `space.authority` handler).
  The engine's contract stops at: declare, validate, scope, eject.
- Rename `topic` → `space` throughout: `UseAddThread`/`UseAddHandler`/`UseTrigger`
  (and later `useBehavioral`) partial-application params, `RunningBid`/`PendingBid`/
  `CandidateBid`/listener `topic` fields, trace snapshot fields, `generateRulesFunctions`.
- **Declared spaces.** `behavioral()` gains `useCreateSpace` (returns
  `(id: string) => void`; naming consistent with the other hooks). Every
  partially-applied hook — `useAddThread(space)`, `useAddHandler(space)`,
  `useTrigger(space)`, and later `useBehavioral(space)` — validates the space exists at
  bind time and **throws** on an undeclared space. Root (no space argument) stays
  valid — that's the unscoped channel.
- **New trace kind `space_error`** (`TRACE_MESSAGE_KINDS`): a scoped hook bound to an
  undeclared space publishes `{ kind, timestamp, space, operation, error }` on the
  trace publisher *before* throwing (the throw is for the caller; the trace is for
  the system — gate-visible when a generated thread binds against a nonexistent
  space). The trace is emitted by the hook itself, not caught from the throw.
- `useEject(space)` — new member of the frozen API object. Imperative, unblockable,
  orchestration-level only (called from handlers or harness code downstream of a
  triggered ingress event — the *decision* to eject stays gateable at that ingress;
  the eject mechanism itself is a hard floor that generated threads cannot veto).
  - Sweep `pending` and `running`: for bids with matching space,
    `generator.return?.()` + delete (reuses the exact `interrupt` teardown path in
    `resumePendingThreadsForSelectedEvent`).
  - Handlers: `useAddHandler(space)` already returns a per-registration `Disconnect`;
    additionally each registration is recorded in an engine-side per-space registry,
    and `useEject` runs all of them (caller-held disconnects remain valid for
    individual removal — two removal paths, one subscription each).
  - **Eject deletes the declaration.** Post-eject, the space id is undeclared: binds
    against it throw. Re-creating an ejected id via `useCreateSpace` is allowed —
    fresh generation, no zombie state survives the sweep.
  - Observability: publish a new `space_ejected` trace kind, payload
    `{ space, threads: string[] (labels), handlers: number, timestamp }` (+ `step`
    if swept mid-super-step). No synthetic event enters the selection pipeline —
    the event log stays clean.
  - `useAddThread` keeps returning void; the space string is the handle.
  - `behavioral()` stays parameterless (no options bag).
- **Observability asymmetry is intentional:** root `useTrace` sits on the publisher
  and sees every space's traces; a space's consumers only see what their own
  handlers/triggers touch. Space isolation is stamping discipline + the registration
  gate, not a hard VM boundary — hard boundaries come from execution placement
  (Phase 7), not from the engine.
- Algorithm untouched: `computeFrontier`/`selectNextEvent` read the surviving pending
  set fresh each super-step; the sweep happens between steps, exactly where interrupt
  already mutates them.
- Deliberate non-goal: graceful teardown *patterns* (waitFor trapdoor, block as
  withdrawal guard, reverse-dependency shutdown) remain thread-authored conventions
  (proposal §1, §5), not engine machinery. `useEject` is the floor beneath them.

**Done when:** tests prove — binding any scoped hook to an undeclared space throws
*and* publishes a `space_error` trace; eject removes a space's pending + running
threads and its handlers (events of that space no longer dispatch), deletes the
declaration (post-eject binds throw, re-creation works), and publishes a
`space_ejected` trace; other spaces unaffected; frontier computation post-eject is
identical to a program that never had the space; rename compiles with zero behavior
change in the existing suite.

---

## Phase 0 — Open Responses stream contract

**Goal:** define the model boundary as an Open Responses-shaped request/stream, with a
user-provided adapter seam. pi-ai is at most one future adapter, not a dependency.

**Deliverables:**

- `src/agent/open-responses.schemas.ts` — Zod schemas for the minimal request shape
  (`model`, `input` items incl. `function_call`/`function_call_output` with `call_id`,
  `tools`, `truncation: 'auto'|'disabled'`, `instructions`) and the minimal stream
  event union (`OpenResponsesStreamEvent`) incl. terminal-event `usage`
  (`input_tokens`/`output_tokens`/`total_tokens`) and the spec-native `compaction`
  item type (`/v1/responses/compact` returns `{ type: 'compaction',
  encrypted_content }` — sent back as base input; adapters synthesize it for
  providers without a compact endpoint).
- `src/agent/use-response.ts` — `type UseResponse = (req) =>
  AsyncIterable<OpenResponsesStreamEvent> |
  Promise<AsyncIterable<OpenResponsesStreamEvent>>` and
  `type Adapter = { provider, respond: UseResponse }`, plus the `useResponse`
  factory (validate provider non-empty, freeze). Repo pattern: camelCase function,
  PascalCase-of-name type (`useTrigger`/`UseTrigger`). Contract documented: never
  throw, encode failure as a terminal error event. The daemon routes by `provider`
  name; adapters wire through `useResponse`.
- `src/agent/` adapter seam: adapters are plain modules (no `adapters/` nesting —
  with IoC there's no registry to organize). Contract: adapter modules export a
  factory wiring `{ provider, respond: UseResponse }` through `useResponse` —
  the daemon routes model traffic by `provider` name without a lookup map. Scenario
  data for test doubles stays in tests; when `--seed` needs named scenarios the
  daemon reads them from the plugin/`.agents` surface.

**Done when:** tests drive a scripted adapter (a `UseResponse` bound via
`useResponse`) through deltas → terminal error → abort;
`bun --bun tsc --noEmit` clean.

---

## Phase 1 — The agent loop as a b-program

**Goal:** replace pi's `runLoop` with b-threads. Coordination (steering, abort, stop
conditions) is expressed as threads, not callbacks.

**Deliverables:**

- `src/agent/threads.ts` — a file of threads: the turn loop thread (see shape
  below), the stream-adapter handler, the stop-condition thread, and the compaction
  thread.
- **Spec events verbatim — no `llm.*` translation layer.** The stream-adapter
  handler iterates the adapter's `UseResponse` (yielding typed
  `OpenResponsesStreamEvent`s) and triggers each as a b-event as-is:
  `trigger({ type: event.type, detail: <event fields minus type> })`. Phase 0's
  typed events make an invented `llm.*` vocabulary redundant; traces then show
  spec-aligned event types end to end (Phase 4's `toItems` projection reads the
  same types the loop matched on).
- Loop thread reacts declaratively via `detailSchema` matching:
  - tool calls arrive as `response.output_item.done` with `detailSchema` matching
    `item.type: 'function_call'` — no separate toolCall event;
  - terminal wait is the three spec terminal types:
    `waitFor: ['response.completed', 'response.failed', 'response.incomplete']`.
- Cancellation is an `interrupt` on the loop thread's rules, not a separate
  thread: the loop carries `interrupt: [{ type: 'cancel' }]` at each step, so
  triggering `cancel` in the space tears the turn down via the interrupt path.
- Stop-condition as a thread requesting `turn.end`, not a callback.
- **Tool dispatch is handler-side (discovered in Phase 1 implementation).** Threads
  are static data and cannot request dynamically-named events (`<tool name>` varies
  per response). The `respond` handler collects `function_call` items during stream
  iteration and dispatches tool events after the stream completes; the loop thread
  re-awaits `respond` (its first rule waits on `user.prompt` OR `respond`) after
  tool results append via a generic `tool.result` event (engine handlers match
  exact-type only; `<tool name>_result` still fires for trace visibility).
- Loop thread shape (looping, no `once`), each rule carrying the cancel interrupt:
  `{ waitFor: [user.prompt, respond], interrupt: [cancel] }` → request respond →
  `{ waitFor: [terminal types], interrupt: [cancel] }` → (handler dispatches tools;
  results re-trigger respond) → loop.
  The ingress event is `user.prompt`, triggered into the space by the CLI (Phase 6
  input `{ space, prompt }`).
- Stop condition thread **loops** (no `once`): every `response.completed` requests
  `turn.end` — a once-thread dies after turn one and the harness loses the
  turn-done signal for subsequent turns.
- Harness coordination events (`user.prompt`, `respond`, `tool.result`,
  `context.threshold`, `compaction.start/done`, `turn.end`) are legitimate
  vocabulary distinct from spec stream event types; stream events appear verbatim
  as spec types.
- Context management as a b-thread: after each turn's terminal event, a compaction
  thread reads the terminal event's `usage.input_tokens` and compares against the
  model's context limit, declared on the adapter (`Adapter` gains an optional
  `contextWindow: number` — the spec doesn't carry it; adapters know their
  providers). Below threshold it does nothing; at/above threshold it blocks the
  loop's next stream request until a compaction completes (provider compact
  endpoint or adapter-synthesized summary producing a `compaction` item, which
  becomes base input). Use `truncation: 'disabled'` so overflow is a hard,
  catchable error — never silent degradation. The compaction gate is a plain
  block/waitFor pattern; no callback.
- **Phase 0 follow-up (schema gap):** `CompactionItem` is output-only —
  `InputItemSchema` cannot carry a compaction item as base input, so the Phase 1
  compaction handler wrapped `encrypted_content` in a user message (MINIMAL'd).
  Add `compaction` to `InputItemSchema` and feed the real item back as base input.

**Done when:** tests prove — happy path (prompt → stream → tool call → result →
next stream), cancel mid-turn via interrupt, terminal error stops the turn,
threshold crossing blocks the next stream until compaction completes. All
coordination appears as events in traces (assert via `useTrace`); event types in
traces are spec event types, not an invented vocabulary.

---

## Phase 2 — `defineTool` factory (built-in tools)

**Goal:** tools are makeCli-style units wired as handler + descriptor, validated at
dispatch time. Reference: `research/behavioral-agent-harness-proposal.md` §4 (this
section supersedes the abandoned engine sketch) and Phase 1's discovered reality
(threads are static data — dynamic dispatch lives in handlers). Tools are
**built-in only** — packs never contribute tools (Phase 7).

**Deliverables:**

- `src/tools/define-tool.ts` — internal utility analogous to `useBehavioral`,
  taking a pure `ToolArgs` data object (no engine imports, testable standalone) and
  returning a `({ addHandler, addThread, trigger }) => ToolDescriptor` registrar.
  `defineTool`:
  - shape-validates `inputSchema` and `outputSchema` (JSON Schema documents) with
    `JsonSchemaObjectSchema` (the engine's exported single source of truth for "is
    this a JSON Schema document?");
  - validates the tool `name` at registration (non-empty, no `_result` suffix, no
    `tool.result` collision);
  - compiles `outputSchema` via Ajv to validate the tool's return value;
  - registers the handler on event type `name`: reads `{ call_id, arguments,
    item_id }` from the event detail (a private harness contract, not a spec item
    shape), calls `run(arguments)`, validates the output against `outputSchema`,
    and triggers `tool.result` with `{ call_id, output, item_id }`. `threads.ts`
    owns building the spec-valid `function_call_output` (id + status) from that.
  - returns a frozen `ToolDescriptor { name, inputSchema, outputSchema,
    description? }` for the dispatch-time registry.
- **No guard thread.** A block-idiom guard thread here could never fire: dispatch-
  time validation in `threads.ts` only triggers the tool event with already-
  validated arguments, so the block listener was dead code. Dispatch-time
  validation is the sole schema gate. Semantic block-idiom guards are Phase 5.
- **Spec-valid `function_call_output`.** `threads.ts` captures the `function_call`
  item's `id` as `item_id`, threads it through the tool event, and builds a
  spec-valid `function_call_output` in the `tool.result` handler — fresh `id` via
  `ueid()`, `status: 'completed'|'failed'`, `call_id` correlation. Per the Open
  Responses spec ("Required item fields"), every item MUST carry `id` + `type` +
  `status`; the output item is a NEW item (its `id` ≠ the call's `id`; `call_id`
  is what correlates). This makes the items store a spec-valid, round-trippable
  trajectory — `previous_response_id` resume and `replayToFrontier` restore
  (Phase 4) both depend on addressable items.

**Done when:** tests prove valid call → `tool.result` (echoes `call_id`); malformed
call → `tool_call_blocked` + error `tool.result`; two parallel same-tool calls
correlate by `call_id`; a tool schema that is not a valid JSON Schema document is
rejected at registration; the `function_call_output` in the next request carries
`id` + `status` + `call_id`.

---

## Phase 2.5 — Default tool pack (pi-equivalent core tools)

**Goal:** the agent's hands. Reimplement pi's default built-in tools — `read`, `bash`,
`edit`, `write`, `grep`, `find`, `ls` — as `defineTool` units, carrying JSON Schema,
no guard threads, and space-deployability natively (no callback-shaped pi tools).

**Deliverables:**

- `src/tools/` — one file per tool (`read.ts`, `bash.ts`, `edit.ts`, `write.ts`,
  `grep.ts`, `find.ts`, `ls.ts`), each exporting a frozen `ToolArgs` object
  (`{ name, inputSchema, outputSchema, run, description }`) — plain data, no hooks,
  testable without the engine. Schemas are JSON Schema documents (validated by
  `JsonSchemaObjectSchema` at registration); `run` cores are pure async functions,
  errors returned as data (`isError`/structured errors — never thrown). Bun APIs:
  `bash` via `Bun.spawn`
  (`shell -c` interpreter bridge, native `timeout`/`killSignal`) with
  tail-truncated (last 2000 lines / 50KB, UTF-8-safe) control-char-sanitized
  output — the tool `description` carries that contract to the model;
  file tools via `Bun.file`/`Bun.write`; `find`/`ls` via `Bun.Glob`; `grep` prefers
  `rg` (`Bun.which` + `Bun.spawn`) with a JS line-scanner fallback (`MINIMAL:`).
- **`edit` constructs its unified patch — no `diff` dependency, no streaming.** The
  edit location is known (`old_text` → `new_text` at matched line ranges), so the
  patch is built from the edit range with context lines — ~dozens of lines,
  deterministic, no Myers/LCS. Port pi's line-ending helpers
  (`detectLineEnding`/`normalizeToLF`/`restoreLineEndings` pattern from
  `packages/agent/src/harness/tools/edit-diff.ts`); fuzzy-match normalization is a
  `MINIMAL:` defer. Enforce match discipline: `old_text` must match exactly once
  unless `replace_all`.
- **The bun-runtime skill governs API choices** (`~/.agents/skills/bun-runtime/`):
  verify Bun APIs via its Mode 1 lookup (`plaited mcp-client` →
  `https://bun.com/docs/mcp`, `search_bun`) instead of asserting from memory;
  no `node:fs` (Node `node:path` is fine); no Python/heredocs.
- pi's harness tools (`packages/agent/src/harness/tools/`) are **behavioral
  examples only** — fetch via `gh` for semantics (match discipline, truncation,
  result shapes), never for code (TypeBox, `diff` dep).
- `src/agent/provision-defaults.ts` — the harness-side provisioner: imports the tool
  data from `src/tools/` and wires each via `defineTool`;
  `provisionDefaults(rootHooks)` registers all seven at root. Provisioning is
  harness code (the agent decides what activates where); the tool data stays pure.
- Space-deployable variants: the same `ToolArgs` data provisions into any space
  via space-scoped hooks; a policy pack can substitute a restricted variant
  (read-only set, remote-executing `bash`).
- These are the critical path to a useful agent — the CLI conversions (Phase 3) are
  additive on top.

**Done when:** each tool passes schema validation at registration (Phase 2); tests
drive each through a b-program (trigger call → `tool.result`); dispatch-time
validation blocks a malformed `bash` call and emits `tool_call_blocked`; provisioning
the same tool at root and in a space works independently (space-scoped result
events).

---

## Phase 2.75 — Binary tool & multi-modal input

**Goal:** the agent reads binary files, detects image/audio/video MIME types via
magic bytes, encodes as base64 — so it can feed multi-modal content into model
requests. The Open Responses input schema carries `input_text`, `image`, `audio`,
and `video` content part types, matching the spec's multi-modal
`MessageItemParam.content`.

**Deliverables:**

- `src/tools/binary.ts` — frozen `ToolArgs` object following the Phase 2.5 tool
  pattern: reads a file via `Bun.file(path).bytes()`, detects MIME type from
  **offset-aware magic bytes** (RIFF/ftyp containers match the format tag at
  offset 8, per pi's `image.ts`), encodes as base64, returns
  `{ mimeType, base64, bytesRead, width?, height?, imageFormat? }`. Detection
  covers JPEG, PNG, GIF, WebP, BMP (image — BMP needs a structural check, plain
  text can start with "BM"); MP3, WAV, OGG, FLAC, AAC (audio); MP4, WebM, AVI,
  QuickTime (video) — WAV/AVI/WebP share the RIFF container, discriminated at
  offset 8. Error results (isError + message, never thrown) for missing files,
  directories, and over-ceiling files.
  **No maxBytes truncation input** — binary truncation produces a corrupt,
  uninterpretable blob; instead a hard ceiling (conservative default, a few MB
  binary) errors over the ceiling — **the limit comes from the active adapter's
  declared capabilities, not a pack constant** (Phase 7: adapters declare what
  they accept and their limits; error messages name the limit and the declaring
  adapter). Edge models (Gemma 4 E2B-class, small context windows) and server
  models get correctly sized guidance from the same pack.
  (verified API — reads width/height/format without decoding pixels; pass bytes,
  never path strings — arbitrary-file-read primitive). Graceful absence on
  exotic/undecodable formats.
- Input content parts in `src/agent/open-responses.schemas.ts`: `input_text`,
  `image` (`data:` URI), `audio` (`data:` URI + format), `video` (`data:` URI +
  format) as a discriminated union distinct from output-side content parts.
  `MessageItemParamSchema.content` accepts `InputContentPart[]`.
  The handler converting `tool.result` into the next `respond` request
  switches on MIME prefix to build the correct content part type (`image`,
  `audio`, `video`) — this is a ~5-line MIME-to-format mapping, no ffprobe
  needed because magic-byte detection already identified the format.
- Wire in `provision-defaults.ts` via `defineTool`.
- Tests: MIME detection unit tests (incl. the RIFF-container disambiguation),
  `Bun.Image.metadata()` dimension extraction on image formats (absent gracefully
  on exotic/undecodable files), file-not-found error path, hard-ceiling rejection,
  input content part schema validation.

**MINIMAL:** no audio duration or video codec extraction. Image dimensions via
`Bun.Image.metadata()` (bytes input, never path) are included for image MIME
types; absent gracefully on exotic/undecodable formats — no gate flag.

**Done when:** `bun --bun tsc --noEmit` clean; `bun test` passes for binary tool
and input-content-part schema tests; `provisionDefaults` wires `binary` at root;
an integration-style test reads a PNG fixture, feeds the data-URI as an `image`
content part in a `respond` request, and the adapter sees the base64 image in the
input.

---

## Phase 3 — Convert `src/cli` units to `defineTool` tools; dissolve `src/cli/`

**Goal:** `git-context`, `markdown`, `mcp-client`, `typescript-lsp` become agent tools
alongside the defaults. The CLI surface they came from goes away — bare `plaited` is
the agent (Phase 6); the only surviving CLI machinery is the entry + `makeCli`.

**Deliverables:**

- Per unit: extract the `run(input)` body into a pure async core
  `(input) => output`, wrap as a `ToolArgs` object, and add as a tool file in
  `src/tools/` (`git-context.ts`, `markdown.ts`, `mcp-client.ts`,
  `typescript-lsp.ts`); `provision-defaults.ts` wires them via `defineTool`. `makeCli`
  keeps parse → core → validate → print for direct CLI use where still needed.
- Move the surviving CLI residue (`makeCli`, request parsing, schema printing) out
  of `src/cli/` — it exists to serve `plaited`'s input/`--schema` surface, not a
  multi-command tool surface.
- Envelope: tool input/output details carry `call_id` top-level (stamped by the loop).

**Done when:** the four tools pass Phase 2.5-style b-program tests (trigger call →
`tool.result`, malformed blocked); they provision at root and into a space;
`src/cli/` is gone; the four tools' prior behaviors are reachable through the agent
(not as standalone subcommands).

---

## Phase 3.5 — MCP/skill discovery: search-mediated progressive disclosure (tools)

**Goal:** three stateless built-in `src/tools/` units + a shared adapter
connection pool, so the kernel can orchestrate a search→pick→load
progressive-disclosure loop over remote MCP tools and local skills. Implements
the 2026-09-07 Decision Log entry. The tools are dumb primitives; the smarts
live in a kernel behavioral thread (Slice F, deferred — recorded below).

**Scope split:** the tool primitives (Slices A–E) are delivered; provisioning
+ the orchestration thread (Slice F) is a **separate, separately-tackled** body
of work, not folded into this phase's deliverables.

**Deliverables (delivered):**

- **Slice A+B — `mcp-client` useTool + adapter pool.** Converted
  `src/tools/mcp-client.ts` from `makeCli` to the `useTool` shape
  (`{ name, description, inputSchema, outputSchema, run }`, concrete
  `Input`/`Output`). All seven modes survive (`call-tool`/`list-tools`/
  `list-prompts`/`get-prompt`/`list-resources`/`read-resource`/`discover`) as a
  7-branch `oneOf` on `mode` (hand-written AJV, cast through `unknown` as
  `JSONSchemaType`). `src/cli/mcp-client.ts` untouched (read-only reference).
  Connections route through `src/kernel/use-plugin-adapter.ts` (renamed from
  the empty `use-plugin-adaptert.ts`): `Map<serverUrl, { client,
  connectPromise, discovery }>` lazily connected, evicted on connect failure,
  closed on teardown — the pi-extension `getSharedClient`+
  `session_shutdown`→`closeSharedClient` pattern. The adapter owns no discovery
  data.
- **Slice C — v2 keychain OAuth provider.** `BunKeychainOAuthProvider`
  (`src/kernel/oauth/`) implements the v2 `OAuthClientProvider` shape from
  `@modelcontextprotocol/client`: issuer-keyed `clientInformation(ctx)`/
  `tokens(ctx)`/`saveTokens(tokens,ctx)`/`saveClientInformation(ci,ctx)`,
  `state()`/`saveDiscoveryState`/`discoveryState`, `validateResourceURL`
  (RFC 8707 origin binding → `IssuerMismatchError`), `invalidateCredentials(scope)`,
  `prepareTokenRequest`/`addClientAuthentication`. Refresh tokens + client info
  persist to the OS keychain via `Bun.secrets` (`BunKeychain`; `InMemoryKeychain`
  is the test double — the only mocked boundary). The hand-rolled
  `buildOAuthRequest`/`exchangeOAuthTokens`/file persistence under
  `~/.plaited/mcp/tokens/` are deleted; the v2 SDK's `auth()` orchestrator does
  RFC 9728 discovery + the token exchange. One provider per server-url, reused
  across process restarts. The adapter pool migrated to the v2
  `@modelcontextprotocol/client` `Client` + `StreamableHTTPClientTransport`.
- **Slice D — `skill-client` useTool (new).** Three modes (`discover`/`read-skill`/
  `list-resources`) mapping to the agentskills.io tiers (metadata → full
  instructions → bundled-resource preview). Own frontmatter parsing (no import
  from `src/cli/markdown.ts`); lenient validation per spec (warn-but-load on
  name/dir mismatch + length; skip+warn on unparseable YAML + missing/empty
  description); project-level overrides user-level on name collision.
  `src/cli/markdown.ts` untouched (read-only reference).
- **Slice E — `discovery` useTool (new).** Five modes (CRUD + `search`) over
  `.plaited/discovery.sqlite` (`bun:sqlite`), unified `kind: 'mcp-tool' |
  'skill'` rows (`id`, `name`, `description`, `handle`, `metadata_json`,
  `updated_at`). The only tool that touches the store. `dbPath` is
  **provisioner-injected** via `createDiscoveryTool({ dbPath })` — deliberately
  absent from the model-facing schema, so a model-supplied `dbPath` is rejected
  at the boundary (`additionalProperties: false`). Not git-backed — local
  SQLite, regenerable.

**Deferred — Slice F (separate body of work):**

- Provision the three primitives via `src/kernel/provision-defaults.ts` so they
  are reachable through the agent. Resolve `.plaited/discovery.sqlite`
  (discovery `dbPath`) and the MCP OAuth keychain against the project root.
- The kernel progressive-disclosure behavioral thread driving the loop:
  `mcp-client discover` / `skill-client discover` → `discovery create/update`
  (persist); `discovery search(query)` → candidates (tier 1); model picks →
  `mcp-client call-tool` or `skill-client read-skill` (tier 2); continue.
  Expressed as `waitFor`/`request`/`trigger` over the fixed built-in tool set
  (plaited-runtime skill patterns). Tools stay dumb.
- Until Slice F lands the three primitives are built, tested, and importable but
  **dormant** — not wired into any provisioner or the agent loop.

**Invariants holding:** the Phase 2/7 "built-in tools only" invariant is intact —
the three primitives are (will be) provisioned, but discovered remote MCP tools
are **never** registered as first-class tools. State this positively so a
reviewer doesn't "fix" it wrong. No static skill catalog in the system prompt
(the deliberate deviation from agentskills.io Step 3 — marked `MINIMAL`). The
store is not git-backed (distinct from Phase 4's git-backed trace logs).

**Done when (Slices A–E):** `bun --bun tsc --noEmit` clean on the changed
surface; `rg "from '.*cli/mcp-client|from '.*cli/markdown" src/tools/
src/kernel/` empty; targeted tests per slice green (55 total: mcp-client 12,
keychain 9, skill-client 15, discovery 19). Slice F has its own done-when under
its separate tackling.

---

## Phase 4 — Space context & persistence

**Goal:** a space is the unit — no "session" abstraction. A space's context is its
event history (traces) plus the threads/tools provisioned in it; persistence is
artifact-based, not a session subsystem.

**Deliverables:**

- `src/agent/space-trace.ts` — per-space trace capture: subscribe via root
  `useTrace`, partition by the space field already present on candidate/selection
  snapshots, append JSONL per space (plus a whole-program log for the running agent).
  The log records thread/tool *registrations* as well as selections — restore
  (below) needs the provisioned set, not just the event stream.
- Projections from a space's trace log:
  - `toItems(log)` → Open Responses item list (function_call /
    function_call_output by `call_id`) — what the model boundary consumes.
  - `toHtml(log)` → human-readable rendering of the space's history.
- Git-backed artifact storage: durable space state (authored thread definitions,
  generated code, trace logs) commits to git — the artifact store, not a bespoke
  database.
- **Restore** a space via `replayToFrontier` over its stored trace prefix, then
  re-provision its threads from their stored definitions, then continue live.
  (Use "restore"/"replay" — not "rehydrate", which carries DOM-rendering
  connotations from the UI layer.)
- Branching = child spaces (a branch is a space partition); abandoning a branch is
  one `useEject(branchSpace)` call (Phase -1). No sub-agent abstraction —
  delegation is child spaces + a root bridge handler forwarding a single result
  event (controlled membrane, gate-visible, ejectable).

**Done when:** tests prove — run a space → persist trace log → fresh program
restores an identical frontier via `replayToFrontier` and identical Open Responses
items via `toItems`; a branch space leaves the original line intact; ejecting a
branch deletes only its artifacts.

---

## Phase 5 — Policy as threads: the default guard pack

**Goal:** no built-in allow-once/allow-always machinery. Guards are threads terminated
by `interrupt` on approval events.

**Deliverables:**

- Guard threads per guarded call: `{ block: [callListener],
  interrupt: [approvalFor(call_id)] }` — policy blocking designed with the
  call_id-correlation problem solved (Phase 2's dispatch-time validation covers
  malformed inputs; this layer covers semantic policy).
- Permission flow: blocked guarded call → `permission.ask` event → handler emits a
  JSON `permission_required` output → the human's answer arrives as a follow-up
  `plaited` command carrying `permissionAnswer` (serve mode: next command to the
  running process; `--no-serve`: next invocation's input) → `permission.resolved`
  trigger → guard interrupted → the pended call becomes selectable. Deny path
  requests the tool's error result so the model sees the refusal.
- Standing policy threads are composable additions (e.g. auto-allow reads under src/).
- Registration gate: the harness wraps `useAddThread` with a `verifyFrontiers` call
  on new thread rules *before* admission, per
  `research/differential-frontier-gate-stable-reward.md` (`verified` admits,
  `failed` rejected with `add_thread_error` trace, `truncated` per policy).
  Full layering in Phase 5.5 Layer 1.

**Done when:** tests prove — guarded call blocked until approval; approval interrupts
the guard and the call executes; deny produces an error `_result`; a malformed or
deadlocking generated guard is rejected by the gate.

---

## Phase 5.5 — Eval loop (autoresearch): gate, tool, observer, skill surface

**Goal:** the self-improving loop from
`research/talk-self-improving-agents-from-behavioral-exhaust.md` — an agent reads its
own exhaust and iterates. Three *separate* gate/observer mechanisms (kept distinct to
avoid meta-regress) plus the third mutable surface (skill text):

**Layer 1 — Registration gate (harness-side; owns the definition).** The harness wraps
`useAddThread` and calls `verifyFrontiers` on the new thread's rules *before*
admission. `verified` admits; `failed` rejects with `add_thread_error`;
`truncated` per policy. Lives in `src/agent/` (not the engine — the engine stays
domain-agnostic and must not pay exploration cost per `useAddThread`). This is the
gate spec'd in `research/differential-frontier-gate-stable-reward.md`. Phase 5
references this layer; this is the single definition.

**Layer 2 — `verify-frontier` tool (agent-callable self-check).** A `defineTool` unit
exposing `verifyFrontiers` inside the b-program:

```
input:  { threads: Thread[] }        (Zod schema; pure candidate data)
output: { status: 'verified'|'failed'|'truncated', findings, livelocks }
```

The agent authors a candidate `Thread[]`, requests `verify-frontier`, waits for
`verify-frontier_result` (correlated by `call_id`), and keeps/discards the candidate
by verdict. **No regress:** the gate operates on the candidate *data* (its own
`pending` set per `exploreFrontiers`), never the live program's frontier — so the
agent verifying a candidate never recurses into verifying itself. The verdict symbol
(`verified`/`failed`/`truncated`) is the in-context training signal (symbol-tuning):
prior `(thread-shape → verdict)` pairs feed the next generation.

**Layer 3 — `useTrace` observer callback (controller-side).** When the orchestrator
(agent A) sets up worker instances (1-n), it passes a `useTrace` listener per worker
program. `useTrace` subscribes to the trace publisher — *outside* the event/action
loop — so it observes without participating: traces never become selected events and
cannot re-enter a worker's frontier. This is the controller's oversight channel
(worker deadlocks, errors, progress), distinct from the worker's own gate (Layer 2).

**Layer 4 — Skill surface (third mutable surface).** Threads and tools gate
symbolically (worker-side, Layer 2); skill text is prose and needs an LLM judge —
so it judges *controller-side*, matching the neuro-symbolic split (worker proposes,
controller disposes):

- `skill` tool (`defineTool` unit, built on the Phase 3 `markdown` core):
  `read-skill` / `write-skill` / `validate-skill` (frontmatter + link validation).
  The agent edits its own skill text through these.
- Judge callback: a controller-side `useTrace` listener (Layer 3 wiring) that, on a
  `skill.proposed` trace, calls an Open Responses judge endpoint — the `judgeJson`
  pattern: one stateless `complete` call `{ model, system, user }` → strict JSON
  verdict (see the DeepSearchQA grader). No external eval harness — the judge is a
  UseResponse/adapter call like any other. The controller then triggers `skill.scored`
  back into the worker's space; the worker keeps or discards the variant.

**The reward function** (`computeThreadReward`: `verified`→1, `truncated`→0,
`failed`→-1) is a pure function of the Layer 1/2 verdict — lives in `src/agent/`
with the eval loop, not the engine.

**Candidate sandbox:** one space per rollout — create, register the verified
candidate, observe in isolation, `useEject`. Reuses Phase -1/4 machinery; no new
engine work. The generator (the agent authoring variants) runs under `--seed`; the
symbolic gate is a pure function and does not consume the seed; the sandbox is a
space. Three separation-of-concerns mechanisms, never conflated.

**Done when:** the agent calls `verify-frontier` on a candidate and receives a
verdict; a `failed` candidate is discarded and a corrected one re-gated; the
controller observes a worker's deadlock via its `useTrace` callback without the
worker reacting to it; a candidate executed in its sandbox space leaves the root
program's frontier identical after eject; a proposed skill variant is judged by the
controller callback and the score event lands in the worker's space.

---

## Phase 6 — CLI entry: `plaited` (cold invocation, gated ingress, dev server)

**Goal:** `plaited` is a normal cold CLI agent — JSON-in/JSON-out, no TUI, no
daemon. There is no warm process: each invocation runs to turn-end and exits.
External actors (a cron job, an atproto space event, Harbor) invoke `plaited`
per trigger through a gated ingress. The interface is the same one the
autoresearch loop and Harbor tasks already drive. (Supersedes the 2024
serve-default daemon model — see Decision Log 2026-09-07 "No daemon".)

**Deliverables:**

- `plaited` (no subcommand) — cold-run a turn in a space. Input
  `{ space, prompt, (optional) permissionAnswer }` → restore the space's
  context from its artifacts (Phase 4) → run to turn-end → persist → print
  JSON. The space is a project folder (Q6/A); one invocation, one space.
- **Gated event ingress.** External triggers must not inject arbitrary events.
  A public-event registry (CRUD-able store, discovery-sqlite pattern) holds
  allowed events as `{ type, space, schema }`; an external trigger is admitted
  only if its type+space is registered and its detail validates against the
  schema. Unauthorized/malformed events are rejected at the boundary. The CLI
  prompt path is the one built-in ingress; everything else registers a public
  event. (Q1/B)
- **Scripted-model validation mode** — `plaited --seed <n>` runs against the
  scripted model seam (the deterministic, no-network model used by the kernel
  turn loop). Deterministic, reproducible: the same seed reproduces a turn
  bit-for-bit. Scope note: `--seed` seeds the *generator* (the model stream);
  the frontier gate (`frontier-verify`) is a pure function of thread data and
  is already deterministic — it does not consume the seed.
- **Generative-UI dev server.** `plaited` (or a `plaited ui` subcommand)
  spins up a local dev server built on `src/controller/` + `src/tools/html.ts`
  serving the memory + shared human-agent context UI over WebSocket (Q5).
  The agent renders into it via `html-render`/`html-update-attributes`; the
  human selects a space and collaborates there. The server is a space-local
  surface, not the agent host.
- Root provisioning at startup: the default plugin (Q2 — `skills/behavioral/` +
  `threads/` + `mcp.json`) + the built-in tool set at root; spaces get
  subsets/variants per their allow/blocklists (Q4).

**Done when:** `plaited '{"space":"s1","prompt":"..."}'` completes a turn cold
(no daemon) and prints JSON; `plaited --seed 42` reproduces a turn bit-for-bit
twice; an unregistered external event is rejected at the ingress boundary and a
registered one with a schema-valid detail is admitted; a guarded action returns
`permission_required` and a follow-up `plaited` command completes it; a second
space stays isolated; the dev server serves the memory UI over WebSocket and
reflects an agent-driven `html-render`.

---

## Phase 7 — Extension packs & deployment patterns (pattern surface)

**Goal:** document and enable the pack ecosystem. Aligned with pi's
containerization doc structure (a menu of deployment patterns, not a feature),
minus the experimental micro-VM row.

**Pack contract:**

- A pack is a plugin directory in Agent Plugins format: `plugin.json` manifest plus
  component directories. A pack contributes **threads + handlers** (behavioral
  units), never tools — tools are built-in only (Phase 2). The client-extension
  namespace `dev.plaited/` declares a `packs` object in `plugin.json`:
  ```json
  {
    "extensions": {
      "dev.plaited": {
        "packs": {
          "$root":   { "behaviors": ["./b/compaction.ts"], "tools": ["read","bash"], "excludeTools": ["bash"], "skills": ["tdd","typescript-lsp"], "excludeSkills": ["grilling"] },
          "research": { "behaviors": ["./b/search.ts"], "tools": ["read","grep","find"], "skills": ["you","mdn-web-docs"] }
        }
      }
    }
  }
  ```
  - `$root` is the default key — behaviors and tool/skill config at root scope
    (no space). Every other key is a space/topic name.
  - Each space entry has up to six fields:
    - `behaviors` (file paths) — `useBehavioral` exports, AST-checked before
      admission (the self-improving loop's mutable surface, Phase 5.5).
    - `tools` / `excludeTools` — built-in tool name allow/blocklist (Phase 2).
    - `skills` / `excludeSkills` — skill name allow/blocklist. Skills are
      *instructions loaded into context*, not function-call-dispatched tools, so
      "allowing" a skill means including its SKILL.md content in the agent's
      context for that space; "excluding" means don't load it. Root skills ship
      with the plugin; spaces narrow. The governance shape mirrors tools.
- **The behavior export unit is `useBehavioral(callback)`.** Each file listed in
  `behaviors` is imported; its named exports are all `useBehavioral(...)` results.
  The harness's provisioning handler (harness-side, `src/agent/`) reads the space
  key from `plugin.json`, curries `useTrigger(space)` / `useAddHandler(space)` /
  `useAddThread(space)` into scoped variants, and invokes each export with those
  scoped hooks. Because the files are agent-generated, each export is AST-checked
  before admission — this is the foundation for the self-improving loop
  (Phase 5.5): behavior files are a mutable, agent-editable surface, and writes to
  them are observable events that trigger the verify-then-register cycle.
- `useBehavioral` (consumer-side, `src/agent/use-behavioral.ts`) is a pure identity
  wrapper — its only jobs are to guarantee the export's shape and fix the param
  shape. The callback receives `{ addThread, addHandler, trigger, useTrace }`
  (pre-scoped). The callback's own scope is where co-designed handlers/threads share
  state and `Disconnect` handles — a sibling handler can remove another via the
  caller-held `Disconnect` that `addHandler` returns (Phase -1). `useTrace` is
  included so a self-improving agent can observe its own behavioral exhaust
  (`research/talk-self-improving-agents-from-behavioral-exhaust.md`).
- `useEject(space)` unwinds a pack's space entirely (threads + handlers).
- **Adapter discovery:** a plugin may declare adapters via the client extension
  field in `plugin.json`:
  ```json
  { "extensions": { "plaited": { "adapters": ["./adapters/anthropic.ts"] } } }
  ```
  Paths are relative to the plugin directory; the daemon imports each module's
  default export (the factory contract from Phase 0). Wrong shape = skip + report
  (fail-soft per the plugin spec's component-failure principle). Security note:
  activating a plugin imports its adapter code with daemon privileges — same trust
  boundary as pi extensions.
- Space semantics (authority, membership, atproto binding, tenancy) are pack-level
  concerns expressed as threads/handlers — never engine concerns.

**Deployment patterns (operator concerns, documented not enforced):**

- **Remote tool execution (default posture).** Tool execution is never co-resident
  with the agent runtime. `defineTool`'s `run` is the only execution point, so a
  built-in tool whose `run` delegates over IPC/HTTP/SSH is indistinguishable to the
  engine from a local one. Default tool packs ship remote-capable `run` cores;
  deployment chooses the target. (No specific micro-VM endorsement.)
- **Adapter capabilities are declared, and tools honor them.** An adapter (or its
  settings entry) declares what the bound model accepts and its limits — e.g.
  multi-modal content types accepted (`image`/`audio`/`video`), per-part byte/
  context budgets, context window. Tools and handlers consume that declaration:
  binary/multi-modal caps are enforced against the *active adapter's* declared
  limits (not a pack constant), and over-limit tool-call error messages name the
  limit and the adapter that declared it — so a Gemma-class edge model and a
  server model get correctly sized guidance from the same pack.
- **Whole-process container** — run `plaited agent` itself in Docker (pi's plain-Docker
  pattern). Keys and mounts are the operator's call.
- **Inference gateway** — an Open Responses stream adapter that routes model traffic
  through a credential-injecting gateway (pi's OpenShell pattern). Falls out of the
  Phase 0 adapter seam for free.

**Done when:** docs section published; one example pack (e.g. the default guard pack
from Phase 5 repackaged) demonstrates the contract end-to-end including ejection.

---

## Adoption invariants (not features)

Properties the core must preserve so future directions stay open without the core
committing to them. These are constraints on how we build the phases above, not new
work:

- **The engine never imports atproto.** Spaces remain bare string ids; authority,
  tenancy, and membership are pack-level concerns expressed as threads/handlers.
- **Trace logs stay append-only and ordered.** No rewrites or reordering — a
  self-certifying signed-commit sync shape (CAR/MST) requires it later. Phase 4's
  JSONL is already this; don't break it.
- **Packs are the only integration seam.** Network, identity, sync, and rendering
  concerns (atproto spaces, cloud mirrors, GUI lexicons) bind through the Phase 7
  pack contract. Some packs will run as sidecar processes — the contract already
  permits this since `run`/handlers are plain async functions.
- **Artifacts are complete.** Anything durable (trace logs, thread definitions) is
  sufficient to verify/replay on its own — `replayToFrontier` already demands this.
  Author identity (signing, DIDs) is attached later by a pack, not baked in.
- **The trace log is also the corpus-eval substrate.** Append-only, complete,
  query-able per space — the same artifact a batch/corpus eval (aggregate analysis
  over many runs, e.g. tool-budget / read-discipline / param-compliance queries over
  `trial.trajectory`-style data) consumes. Keep it projection-friendly; don't
  foreclose a dataset-eval service built on it later.

No deployment topology is prescribed: local-only, cloud, local-with-cloud-mirror are
all operator choices the design must remain compatible with.

## Explicitly deferred

- ACP adapter (any version) — revisit when a real client (GUI or Zed) is needed.
- NDJSON warm-process mode — only if per-invocation replay latency hurts.
- v2 notification lifecycle, multi-client, remote transports.
- Long-running hosted agent (REST + WebSocket, per-user spaces) — the spaces
  vocabulary exists to make this possible later; the transport and tenancy layers
  are their own project.
- atproto identity/sync/lexicon packs (agent DID + user DID, trace commits as
  signed records, cloud-mirror PDS, behavioral-rendering lexicon for a future GUI) —
  bind later via the pack seam; no core dependency. Gated on atproto spaces
  stabilizing out of alpha.
- Dataset/corpus eval service (aggregate analysis over many persisted trace logs —
  the third leg alongside the per-thread symbolic gate and the iterative
  autoresearch loop). All three consume the same trace-log artifact; the corpus
  layer is a pack/service concern, not core.
- No session abstraction, ever: the space is the unit. Session-like behaviors
  (restore, branch, history) are space operations over artifacts.
